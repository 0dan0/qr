## GoPro FX Reframe (beta)

The current release version of the tools is posted [within our community pages](https://community.gopro.com/s/article/GoPro-FX-Reframe).

FX Reframe is the ultimate GoPro image reframing tool, while it is marketed for it use with 360 cameras, it is just as useful for reframing any GoPro source footage. 
GoPro's own media team uses this filter on a large percentage of video produced (it is part of the GoPro secret source.)

Here is a beta release v1.4.2  
- Fix for line on left or top edge
- Fix for x,y offsets expanding the edge line
- Reordered the Superview/Hyperview math so that the new projection only apply to the current framing
