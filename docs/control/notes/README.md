# Release Notes 

## HERO10 Black
 - Added !M**HSTO**=x minutes - controlling the length of the Hindsight timeout, changing from the default for 15 minutes. e.g. !MHSTO=60 for a 60 minute Hindsight timeout.
 - Added !M**IWFR**=1 Increased Write FRequency to support for higher precision file recoveries (defaulted on with !MBITR=x also).  
 - Added rate control for slow SD media (activated using either !MBITR=x or !MIWFR=1), allowing for potentially improved capture reliability with older media or at higher bitrates.
 - Added Trust USB !M**TUSB**=1 to allow power from USB with unknown current (assumes USB is 2A source.)
 - Enhanced SPL trigger levels now reported to the qrlog.txt file.
 - Fixed for rare crash when waking the LCD during a Night Lapse video capture.
